                            I'm Imhotep Benjamin, a senior at the University of Maryland Global Campus majoring in Web & Digital Design, with a minor in Computer Science. I kickstarted my academic journey by graduating from Montgomery College with an associate's degree in Integrated Studies in 2021. I'm not just a student; I'm a creative developer well-versed in coding languages like Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My passion for creativity extends beyond coding. Since 2012, I've been immersed in the world of music production. In 2016, I ventured into graphic and digital design, driven by the desire to craft unique visuals for my YouTube channel. My signature style blends grainy textures with abstract elements, giving my visual creations a distinct and captivating edge. This fusion of technology and artistry defines my path as a digital artist and developer.
